I would like to tell you about the **Cart** screen in the Ozon mobile app.

In the center of the screen under the **Ozon delivery** heading, you can see all the products that you have added to the cart. You can see here the information about each product: description, icon, regular price, price when paying with the Ozon card, installment fee. Each of the products you can add to favorites, delete, or change its quantity.

You can mark only those products that you decide to buy using the checkboxes near those products. At the top of the screen, you can mark the **Select all** checkbox to select all the products in the cart. Also you can click the **Delete selected** button to delete the products which were selected.

At the top of the screen, you can select the convenient pick-up point.

Under the list of products, you can see an amount of seller points that you get when buying those products.

After that, the result of your order is summed up. You can see a number of products in your order, their weight, price, discount, and the total cost with and without the Ozon card.

If everything is ok, you can click the **Proceed to registration** button to complete your order.
